# CODTECH-Task-2
Project Title:
"Simple Linear Regression for Predictive Modeling: Analyzing a Synthetic Dataset"

Objective:
To understand and implement simple linear regression, evaluate the performance of the model, and visualize the relationship between input features and predictions.

Steps:
1. Introduction
Explain the concept of linear regression and its applications.
Highlight the importance of evaluating model performance.
2. Dataset
Use a synthetic dataset generated using numpy for simplicity.
Explain the structure:
Feature (X): Random numbers representing input data.
Target (y): Linear relationship with noise.
3. Implementation
Data Preparation:
Generate the synthetic dataset.
Split it into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Use the LinearRegression model from scikit-learn.
Model Prediction:
Predict values for the test set.
Evaluation Metrics:
Compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
4. Visualization
Plot the regression line over the data points.
Show the relationship between actual and predicted values.
5. Analysis
Interpret the MSE and R² scores.
Discuss the quality of the predictions based on visualizations.
6. Conclusion
Summarize findings and insights from the project.
Suggest improvements (e.g., handling more features or using polynomial regression).
Code Implementation
Include the script as-is for reproducibility. You may add comments to explain each section in detail.
